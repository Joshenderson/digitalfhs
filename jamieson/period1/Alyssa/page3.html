			<h2>The Band</h2>

			<p> The Symphonic Band has a variety of students. Any type of student is welcome to join. It's best recommended to have at least 2 years of experience with your instrument.  Because of the eliminated beginning band, students who want to learn an instrument will have a harder time.  In Symphonic band, with its busy schedule, it is hard for students, who learn a new instrument, get the proper amount of one on one time with the teacher.  Luckily, fellow students may help the new student in teaching the fingerings for the notes.</p>
