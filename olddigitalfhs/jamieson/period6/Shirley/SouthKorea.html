		<p>South Korea made it on my bucket list after watching the variety show Running Man. The culture is really rich and there are so many places to explore.</p>

		<h2>Cost</h2>
		<p>current exchange rate US Dollar to Korean Won 1:1056.66</p>
		<p>Korea is fairly expensive compared to most Asian countries, but it is a less expensive than Japan and, when compared to other fully modern, developed, countries, it is on the cheaper side. A frugal backpacker who enjoys eating, living and traveling Korean-style can easily squeeze by on under 60,000 won (56.78 dollars) per day, but if you want a regular hotel and to eat your meals in restruants 200,000 won(189.29)/day is probably more realistic. Seoul has been particularly expensive in recent years due to high real estate values, by some measures even more so than Tokyo, but this has calmed down since the 2008 financial crisis, and while the Won has recovered since then, hotels and restraunts, are still generally lower priced than they were in the 2000s.</p>
		
		<h2> Love Motels</h2>
		<p>located everywhere around the country</p>
		<p>Love motels were motels for couples to do a quickie, now it has been rebranded as design motels and 100% safe for solo female tourists to stay in.</p>
