		<h2>Common Etiquette</h2>
		<p>Japanese people are very conservative so here are some common etiquettes you should know.</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Never walk on a tatami mat wearing shoes or even slippers. Japanese dwellings and Japanese style hotel rooms will have a genkan, a transitional area. Take your shoes off while standing in the genkan, stepping back onto the boarded area of the floor.</li>
				<li>Never enter a public bathtub without washing up first. </li>
				<li>Avoid physical contact in public. You will not see Japanese people kissing or hugging.</li>
				<li>Shoes (and feet in general) are considered very dirty by the Japanese. Avoid pointing your soles at anybody (such as when sitting on the train) and try to restrain children from standing up on seats. Brushing your feet against somebody's clothing, even by accident, is very rude.</li>
				<li>The Japanese consider back slaps rude, especially if they're coming from someone they just met. As it is not common practice in Japan, hugging should also be avoided. For Japanese it is typically very awkward and uncomfortable.</li>
				<li>Point at people with an open hand, not a finger (but pointing this way at things is fine), and tell people to come by waving your hand facing down, not up.</li>
				<li>Avoid shouting or talking loudly in public. Talking on a mobile phone on a train is considered rude, and many trains have signs advising you not to use them. (Sending text messages, however, is considered de rigueur.)</li>
				<li>Blowing your nose in public is considered rude, much like flatulence. It is fine to walk around sniffling until you can find a private place to blow your nose.</li>
				<li>Chopstick rules:<ul>
					<li>Never place or leave chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice, and never pass something from your chopsticks to another person's chopsticks. These are associated with funerary rites. If you want to give a piece of food to someone, let them take it from your plate, or place it directly on their plate.</li>
					<li>When you are done using chopsticks, you can rest them across the edge of your bowl or plate. Most nicer restaurants put a small wooden or ceramic chopstick rest (hashi-oki) at each place setting. You can also fold the paper wrapper that the chopsticks come in to construct your own hashi-oki.</li>
					<li>Licking the ends of your chopsticks is considered low-class. Take a bite of your rice instead.</li>
					<li>Using chopsticks to move plates or bowls (really anything other than food) is rude.</li>
					<li>Pointing at things with your chopsticks is rude. (Pointing at people in general is rude; with chopsticks, doubly so.)</li>
					<li>Spearing food with your chopsticks is generally rude and should be used as only a last resort.</li>

				</ul></li>

		<h2>Toyko is a expensive place.</h2>
		<p>Toyko is the 19th most expensive city so if you plan on going there its best to bring extra cash.
		The current exchange rate from dollar to yen is $1: 107.10 yen </p>
		<p>Japan is expensive in the central high-end shopping and eating areas. Since tourists often flock to these areas, consider purchasing lunch or snacks at a local supermarket before starting your day. A glass of orange juice at a cafe in the centre can cost you more than your entire lunch at the supermarket. Instead of shopping at the well-publicized shopping districts such as Isetan in Shinjuku and Matsuya in Ginza, consider the suburban shopping malls or Aeon / Ito-Yokado.
 		If you find yourself a little short on cash, you can get your essential items in one of the many 100 yen shops (hyaku-en ten) located in most cities. Daiso is the Japan's largest 100 yen shop chain, with 2,500 shops across Japan. Other large chains are Can Do, Seria, and Silk. There are also convenience-store-like 100 yen shops such as SHOP99 and Lawson Store 100 where you can buy sandwiches, drinks, and vegetables in addition to selected 100 yen items.</p>

 		<h3>Akihabara</h3>
 		<p>location:Akihabara is a district in the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo, Japan,on a street just west of Akihabara Station.</p>
 		<p>Akihabara gained the nickname Akihabara Electric Town shortly after World War II for being a major shopping center for household electronic goods and the post-war black market. It is similar to New York's Time Square. Nowadays, Akihabara is considered by many to be an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for video games, anime, manga, and computer goods. There are also numerious maid cafes in the area. </p> <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Akihabara,_electronics_district.jpg">
 		<p>Maid cafes are a subcategory of cosplay restaurants. In these cafes, waitresses dressed in maid costumes act as servants, and treat customers as masters (and mistresses) in a private home, rather than as cafe patrons.</p>
