		<p>I was born in New York City but moved away when I was young, so I couldn't experience all the cool things you could do there. Last summer my mom decide to bring me back to my hometown for a visit and OH MY GAWD it was the most undescribable experience ever. I did not want to leave! The main reason why I'm making this webpage is so that you can virtually experience another city and a guide for you when you decide to travel to New York City.</p>
