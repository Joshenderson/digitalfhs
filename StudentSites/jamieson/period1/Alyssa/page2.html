			<h2>Director</h2>
				<p>Dr. James Sours (Jimmy) is the current band instructer at Franklin. He plays the Tuba, as well as other brass instruments.</p>

				<p>In the past, Jimmy was apart of many professional orchistras and music groups. He has worked here at Franklin for at least 15 years, though, recently he was cut to part time, eliminating the beginning band class.</p>

				<p>Because of this change, he only comes on B Days, with an over-flowing Symphonic band, a limited Jazz band, and both beginning and advanced Orchestras.</p>

				<p>Plus, because of all the new staff members this year, the FHS Choir now shares the band room with us.</p>

				<p>Jimmy is a professional, and the students take his opinion seriously.  He is an amazing conducter and teacher.</p> 

				<p>There wouldn't be any other band teacher more perfect for Franklin!</p>
