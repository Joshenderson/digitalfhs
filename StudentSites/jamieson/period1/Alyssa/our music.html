			<h3>Modern Music</h3>

			<p>The modern music we play usually are based off movies, such as The Lion King and Frozen.  Believe it or not, modern music seems more difficult since majority of the band has watched these movies.  Sometimes, half the band likes it,</p>
			<p>and half the band dislike it.  For example; students like The Lion King, but dislike playing it because its 6 pages long and is 15 minutes from start to finish.  That's why most modern pieces, we wouldn't perform at concerts.</p>
